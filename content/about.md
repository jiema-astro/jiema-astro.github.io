Hi, I'm **Jie Ma**, an astrophysicist with a passion for studying **protoplanetary disks** and **planet formation**. I completed my PhD at ETH Zurich and am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at IPAG, France. My work involves the use of advanced **polarimetry** and **radiative transfer modeling** to understand the **dust evolution** in protoplanetary disks.

I have a deep interest in using cutting-edge observational tools like **VLT/SPHERE**, **VLTI**, and **JWST** to uncover the mysteries of disk structures and dust properties. Outside of my research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring, and contributing to scientific outreach and collaborations.

In my free time, I like to read novels, listen to music, and explore new languages. Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations or discussions!

## Research interests
My research focuses on understanding the processes that shape the formation and evolution of planetary systems, particularly in the context of **protoplanetary disks**. Key areas of my work include:

**Polarimetric Observations**: Developing and applying **polarimetry techniques** to measure the spatial and temporal evolution of dust in disks. Polarimetry is a powerful tool for probing the properties of dust in protoplanetary disks. It provides unique insights into **dust scattering**, allowing us to probe the spatial distribution, size, and composition of dust grains. The degree of polarization is particularly sensitive to the shape of dust, making polarimetry invaluable for studying dust evolution and growth. 

**Radiative Transfer Modeling**: I have developed my own radiative transfer model to simulate the scattered light in geometrically symmetric optically thick disk. Additionally, I have extensive experience with RADMC-3D, a widely-used tool for creating complex disk models. This software allows me to model disk structures, simulate light scattering and thermal emission, and compare synthetic observations with real data to constrain disk properties.

**Dust Characterization**: A particular challenge in extracting scattering information from the observation is caused by PSF convolution effect, which blurs high-resolution images and reduces the accuracy of measurements. However, by carefully accounting for this effect, I can achieve high-accuracy photo-polarimetric measurements, allowing me to provide reliable dust characterization and improve our understanding of disk structure and evolution.
