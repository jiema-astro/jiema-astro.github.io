Hi! My name is Jie. I'm a Ph.D. student in Exoplanets and Habitability group at ETH Zurich under supervison of Prof. H.M. Schmid since Nov. 2019. \\
During my bachelor studies at Wuhan University, I joined the international joint program with Universit$\'e$ Claude Bernard Lyon 1. I did my bachelor thesis at Centre de Recherche Astrophysique de Lyon (CRAL). Then I came to ETH Zurich for master studies and did both semester project and master thesis in my current group. \\

## Research interests
My research project is characterization of dust properties in protoplanetary disks. The dust component in protoplanetary disks is of great interest because it is closely related to planet formation. One popular way to study the dust is throught the direct imaging of the polarized light from the dust on the disk surface. Using high-contrast imaging with PDI (Polarimetric Differential Imaging) mode, we've obtained reflected polarized light from many disks.

We build a simple model describing the disk geometry and scattering process, which has the significant potential characterising dust scattering properties.
