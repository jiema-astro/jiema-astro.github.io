Dust component in protoplanetary disks is closely related to planet formation. The polarized light from the dust on the disk surface can be observed using PDI (Polarimetric Differential Imaging). We build a simple model describing the disk geometry and scattering process, which has the significant potential characterising dust scattering properties.
