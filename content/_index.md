Hi, I'm Jie! 

I am a Ph.D. student at ETH Zurich. My research project is on characterizing dust properties in protoplanetary disks. We build disk models and simulate the observing reflected light by the disk. Comparing the simulations with the VLT/SPHERE DPI observations, we're able to constrain the dust properties.
