Hi, I'm Jie! 

I am a Ph.D. student at ETH Zurich since Nov, 2019. My research project is on characterizing dust properties in protoplanetary disks. We build models and simulate the observing reflected light by the disk inner wall. Comparing the simulations with the VLT/SPHERE PDI observations, we're able to constrain the dust properties.
