Welcome to my personal website! I'm **Jie MA**, an astrophysicist specializing in the study of protoplanetary disks and planet formation. My research combines **high-contrast high resolution imaging**, **radiative transfer modeling**, and **dust characterization** to explore the complex processes that shape planetary systems. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at IPAG, where I use cutting-edge observational tools and numerical simulations to uncover the mysteries of dust in the earliest stages of planet formation. Feel free to explore my work, publications, and research interests!
